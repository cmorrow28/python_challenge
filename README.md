Module 3 Challenge

I originally got stuck on calculating my average change; my change in profit was not calculated correctly. 
So I changed my thought process and code so that the first row was held as a variable to be able to calculate the change in rows.

I also originally used booleans to calculate my greatest increase and decrease, but once I changed my calculation process for average change, using the max and min functions was the simpler option.

My coding came from the coursework that was provided and extension research on the internet to try and understand what the codes actually meant. 
But I had another student explain to me that the code you use has to make sense to me, which was what I was struggling with
Once she helped me work out a way that I could visually see the code working, my process of producing the right code came so much more intuitively.

I think this challenge helped me in realising that I am starting to understand what we talk about in class, and it just requires me to think about processes differently...
Which is not something that comes easily to me - but personal growth is always good as they say
